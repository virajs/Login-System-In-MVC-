# Login-System-In-MVC-
A simple login system in MVC using OAuth and OWIN Katana

This is sample login system using Oauth and owin(katana) authentication. Still it is in development phase  as I am including new features day by day. I want to improve this project into a better project by including much more functionalities. I started this as an hobby to develop an e-commerce website with the paypal and some functionalities. As of now developed a simple login system with authentication through mail. Please suggest some ideas how this can be improved into a full fledged e-commerce website.
